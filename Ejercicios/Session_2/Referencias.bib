  abstract = {The Miller-Bravais and Weber symbols for planes and directions in hexagonal crystals can be interpreted as four-dimensional vectors, which are confined to a particular three-dimensional section of 4-space by the rule that the first three indices sum to zero. This is useful for the calculation of distances and angles in hexagonal crystals. The direction symbolized by [uvtw] is that of the cartesian 4-vector [u, v, t, 2w] and the normal to the plane (hkil) is the cartesian vector [h, k, i, l/2], where 2= (2/3)* (c/a). The angle between two of these 4-vectors is given by the usual formula cos a = (rl • r2)/rlr2, and other useful vector equations apply to these 4-vectors just as for the 3-vectors associated with Miller indices. Seeming inconsistencies in the naming of axes for the reciprocal lattice of a hexagonal structure are eliminated by regarding the direct lattice as the projection on to three dimensions and the reciprocal lattice as the three-dimensional section of four-dimensional lattices reciprocal to each other.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an incremental algorithm to compute the covering graph of the lattice generated by a family B of subsets of a totally ordered set X. The implementation of this algorithm has O(((|X|+|B|).|B|).|F|) time complexity, where F is the number of elements in the lattice. This improves the complexity of the previous algorithms which is roughly in O(Min(|X|, |B|)3.|F|). This algorithm may be used in many applications in computer sciences such as the computations of Galois (concept) lattice, the maximal antichains lattice or the Dedekind-MacNeille completion of a partial order. All these lattices can be computed incrementally using this algorithm without increasing time complexity.},

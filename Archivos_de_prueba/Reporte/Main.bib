  abstract = {The particle number and energy fluctuations in a system of charged particles are studied in the canonical ensemble for nonzero net values of the conserved charge. In the thermodynamic limit, the fluctuations in the canonical ensemble differ from those in the grand canonical ensemble. A system with several species of particles is considered. We calculate the quantum statistical effects that can be taken into account for the canonical ensemble fluctuations in the infinite-volume limit. The fluctuations of the particle numbers in the pion-nucleon gas are considered in the canonical ensemble as an example of the system with two conserved charges-baryonic number and electric charge. {\textcopyright} 2005 The American Physical Society.},

We study the equilibrium conditions and determine the equation of state for two to seven dimensions. The results show that the pressure is in agreement with different theoretical models based on the virial expansion As expected, when the dimension of the space increases, the system of hard spheres loses its structure and the pressure decreases.},

  abstract = {We propose strict canonical and microcanonical Monte Carlo algorithms for an arbitrary lattice-gas binary mixture. We deduce formulas that allow us to obtain field quantities over the ensembles in which their conjugate extensive quantities are conserved. As an example, we have considered a lattice-gas mixture that is equivalent to the spin-1 Blume-Emery-Griffiths model [Phys. Rev. A 4, 1071 (1971)]. For a finite system and near a phase coexistence, the field as a function of its extensive conjugate shows a loop that disappears in the thermodynamic limit giving rise to the usual tie line. The first-order phase transition was determined by the use of three criteria. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

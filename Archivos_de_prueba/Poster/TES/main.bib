abstract = "We report on the surface UV index (UVI) variations in Santiago (Chile) a city with high air pollution and complex surrounding topography. Ground-based UV measurements were continuously carried out between January 1995 and December 2011, by using a multi-channel filter radiometer (PUV-510). Ground-based measurements and satellite-derived data retrieved from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS), the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), and the Scanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY), were compared. We found that satellite-derived UVI products largely overestimate surface UVI. Our ground-based UVI measurements were significantly lower than TOMS-derived UVI data: (46.1±6.3)% (in the period 1997–2003), and OMI-derived UVI data: (47.0±6.3)% (in the period 2005–2007). Clear-sky SCIAMACHY-derived UVI were found to be also nearly systematically greater than ground-based UVI measurements in the period 2002–2011. An exceptionally long period of clear skies between December 2010 and January 2011 was used to test further satellite-derived UVI data; in the whole period, OMI and SCIAMACHY data were 53.1% and 38.3% greater than our ground-based measurements, respectively. These differences are presumably due to aerosol load associated with the local pollution and the complex topography surrounding Santiago. In addition, linear regression allowed us to estimate trends that we use for forecasting. Methodological details are provided below."

  abstractnote = {&lt;p&gt;The city of Pretoria in South Africa receives considerable solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) because of its low latitude (22–35°S) and relatively clear skies. Certain meteorological factors affect the amount of solar UVR that reaches the ground; the most dominant factors being stratospheric ozone, cloud cover and solar zenith angle. It is known that overexposure to solar UVR may lead to the development of adverse health conditions, the most significant being skin cancer. Outdoor workers spend a significant amount of time outside and are thus susceptible to this risk. In this case study, we estimated, for the first time, the realtime solar UVR exposure of an outdoor worker in Pretoria. Measurements were made on 27 and 28 May 2013 using a handheld ultraviolet index (UVI) meter calibrated against a science-grade biometer at the South African Weather Service in Pretoria. Personal exposure estimation was used to discern the pattern in diurnal and annual sunburn risk for the outdoor worker. Ambient UVR levels ranged from 0 UVI to 4.66 UVI and the outdoor worker’s potential exposure estimates regularly exceeded 80% of these levels depending on the time of day. The risk of sunburn was evident; however, actual incidents would depend on individual skin photosensitivity and melanin content, as well as sun protection used. Further research is needed to determine the personal exposure estimations of outdoor workers in other provinces in which solar UVR levels may be equally high, or higher than those in Pretoria.&lt;/p&#38;gt;},
